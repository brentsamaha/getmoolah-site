  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Last updated: February 22, 2026</p>

  <p>Moolah (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo;, or &ldquo;the app&rdquo;) is a price tracking app. This policy explains what data we collect, why, and how we protect it.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>When you create an account, we collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email address</strong> &mdash; used for authentication and to send price drop alerts.</li>
    <li><strong>Name</strong> (optional) &mdash; used to personalize your experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Authentication identifiers</strong> &mdash; if you sign in with Apple or Google, we receive an opaque user ID from those services. We do not receive or store your Apple or Google password.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When you use the app, we collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Product URLs and prices</strong> &mdash; the links you share with Moolah and the prices we scrape from those pages.</li>
    <li><strong>Device push token</strong> &mdash; used solely to deliver price drop notifications to your device.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To track product prices and send you alerts when prices drop.</li>
    <li>To personalize your greeting and notification preferences.</li>
    <li>To improve the app&rsquo;s reliability and fix bugs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>We use the following services to operate Moolah:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Supabase</strong> &mdash; database, authentication, and serverless functions (hosted in the US).</li>
    <li><strong>Railway</strong> &mdash; cloud hosting for our backend price-checking service.</li>
    <li><strong>Firecrawl</strong> &mdash; web scraping service used to extract product and pricing data from retailer pages.</li>
    <li><strong>Apple Push Notification Service (APNs)</strong> &mdash; to deliver push notifications.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Sign-In</strong> &mdash; if you choose to sign in with Google.</li>
    <li><strong>Sign in with Apple</strong> &mdash; if you choose to sign in with Apple.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each service has its own privacy policy governing its use of data.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Your data is retained for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account (available in the app under Account settings), all personal data including tracked items, alerts, notification history, and your profile are permanently removed.</p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>We use industry-standard measures to protect your data, including encrypted connections (HTTPS/TLS), row-level security policies on our database, and secure token-based authentication.</p>

  <h2>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Moolah is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can delete it.</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access your data at any time through the app.</li>
    <li>Update your name and notification preferences in Account settings.</li>
    <li>Delete your account and all associated data from within the app.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated through the app. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.</p>
