  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">Last updated: February 22, 2026</p>

  <p>Welcome to Moolah. By creating an account or using the app, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, please do not use Moolah.</p>

  <h2>1. What Moolah Does</h2>
  <p>Moolah is a price tracking app. You share product links with the app, and we periodically check those pages for price changes and notify you when prices drop. Moolah is a tool for informational purposes and does not guarantee the accuracy, availability, or timeliness of any pricing data.</p>

  <h2>2. Your Account</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must provide a valid email address or use Sign in with Apple / Google to create an account.</li>
    <li>You are responsible for keeping your account credentials secure.</li>
    <li>You may delete your account at any time from the Account tab in the app. Deletion is permanent and removes all your data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use Moolah for any unlawful purpose.</li>
    <li>Attempt to interfere with, disrupt, or overload the service.</li>
    <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of the app.</li>
    <li>Use automated systems (bots, scrapers) to interact with Moolah beyond normal app usage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>The Moolah app, its design, branding, and Moolisa mascot are the property of their respective owners. You may not copy, modify, or redistribute any part of the app without permission.</p>

  <h2>5. Price Data &amp; Accuracy</h2>
  <p>Prices displayed in Moolah are scraped from third-party retailer websites. We do our best to provide accurate data, but we cannot guarantee that prices are correct, current, or complete. Always verify the price on the retailer&rsquo;s website before making a purchase. Moolah is not responsible for pricing errors, out-of-stock items, or missed alerts.</p>

  <h2>6. Notifications</h2>
  <p>Moolah sends push notifications for price drops and periodic digests. You can customize or disable notifications in the app&rsquo;s Account settings or through your device&rsquo;s system settings. We are not responsible for notifications that are delayed or not delivered due to device settings, network conditions, or Apple&rsquo;s push notification service.</p>

  <h2>7. Availability</h2>
  <p>We aim to keep Moolah available and reliable, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted service. We may temporarily suspend the service for maintenance, updates, or unforeseen issues. We reserve the right to discontinue the service at any time with reasonable notice.</p>

  <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Moolah and its creator are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app, including but not limited to missed price drops, incorrect pricing data, or purchase decisions made based on information from the app.</p>

  <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Material changes will be communicated through the app. Continued use of Moolah after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised terms.</p>
